    \item Identifying learning problems \\
    Part (a) and (b)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Predictive maintenance:\\
        Data: large amount of irregular factory data \\
        Goal: to minimizes the risk of unexpected failures and reduces the amount of unnecessary preventive maintenance activities.
        humans can't do this task more accuratetely as Machines because its hard to manage billions of data without any automated or smart system.
        \item Customer support \\
        Data: large volume of customer data  (quantitative data, historical data) \\
        Goal: to improve chatbots and conversational interfaces for customer service.\\
        Human can do this task more better than any smart device because they can think of quick answers which machine cant do.
        \item Product recommendation \\
        Data: purchase history for a customer and a large inventory of products\\
        Goal: to identify those products in which that customer will be interested and likely to purchase.\\
        human cant do this task better than intelligent devices because its depend on the historical purchases which need to maintain all records manually.

    \item General equation is  w \(>\) x + b = 0 \\

        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{q2-img1}
    \end{figure}
    
    w \(\epsilon \) \(\mathbb{R}\) d is a non-zero normal vector \\
    
    b is a scalar intercept \\
    
    Divides the space in half, i.e. w \(>\) x + b \(>\) 0 and w \(>\) x + b \(<\) 0 \\
    
    A hyperplane is a line in 2D and a plane in 3D \\
    
    \begin{figure}[h]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{q2-img2}
        \caption{If two points, p and q are both on the line, then w \(>\) (p \(-\) q) = 0}
    \end{figure}

    p  \(-\) q is an arbitrary vector parallel to the line, thus w is orthogonal
    
    \(w_\ast = w \parallel w \parallel \) is the unit normal vector\\
    We want to find distance between a and line in direction of \(w_\ast\) \\
    If we define point \(a_0\) on the line, then this distance corresponds to length of \(a - a_0\)
    in direction of \(w_\ast\) , which equals \(w_\ast > (a - a_0)\)\\
    Since \(w>a_0 = -b\), the distance equals \( \frac{1}{\parallel w \parallel}(w^\top a + b)\)\\
    Similarly the signed distance from a point \(x^*\) to decision boundary (hyperplane) H is\\

    \(d(x^*, H) = \frac{w^\top x^* + b}{\parallel w \parallel}\)

	\item Distribution of weight and height among the citizens genders
	\begin{enumerate}
        \item Scatter plot

            \includegraphics[width=10cm]{scatter_plot_line1}

		\item We would say that he/she is his father, but we cannot guarantee that because we do not know the hight value.
		\item Scatter plot with vertical line to best seperate male and female citizens
		\begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=10cm]{scatter_plot_line2}
        \end{figure}
        \item We would say that he/she is his sister, because according to the plot, almost all of the citizens 
        above the hight of 173 are females.
        \item Scatter plot with line to best seperate male and female citizens
		\begin{figure}[h]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=10cm]{scatter_plot_line3}
        \end{figure}
        \item We would classify he/she as a "female" and no we would not classify 
        differently if we use (b) or (d) lines because all of the citizens in that area 
        are females.
